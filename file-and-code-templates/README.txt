    2. now right click on the package you just made and mouseover/click New
    3. now BEFORE YOU CLICK ON JAVA CLASS BC MUSCLE MEMORY THINGS, go to the middle section of the tiny window that popped out of mousing over New 
        and you should see the name of the template you just saved. click the heck out of it
